        <h1>OG Fortnite: A Blast From The Past</h1>
        <img src="Assets/OG fortnite.jpg">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Fortnite has evolved tremendously since its early days, but for many players, the original version holds a
            special place in their hearts. With iconic weapons, map changes, and unforgettable moments, let’s take a
            trip down memory lane and revisit what made OG Fortnite so memorable.</p>
        <h1>Weapons</h1>
        <h2>Weapons Added:</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Pump Shotgun</h3>
        <br>
        A fan-favorite, the Pump Shotgun became the weapon of choice for close-range combat. Its ability to deal high
        damage in one shot made it a staple in any player's arsenal.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Scar (Assault Rifle)</h3>
        The Legendary and Epic versions of the Scar were top-tier in terms of damage output and
        accuracy.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Rocket Launcher</h3>
        <br>
        The Rocket Launcher offered devastating explosive power, perfect for taking down structures or
        multiple enemies at once.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Weapons Vaulted:</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Dual Pistols</h3>
        <br>
        Though not the most popular, the Dual Pistols offered a unique dual-wielding experience that was
        vaulted after the early days of the game.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Crossbow</h3>
        While it provided an interesting mechanic with its ability to fire bolts, it didn’t quite make a
        lasting impact and was eventually removed.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Tactical Submachine Gun</h3> 
        A favorite for many due to its fast rate of fire, the Tactical SMG was vaulted to make
        room for new weapons and meta shifts.
