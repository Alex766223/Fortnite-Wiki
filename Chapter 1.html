            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Chapter 1 is the original season of Fortnite, which set the foundation for the game's mechanics,
                progression, and popular features. It introduced several iconic weapons and items, as well as the
                concept of boss fights and map changes over time. Here's a breakdown of weapons added, weapons vaulted,
                and bosses that featured in Chapter 1:</p>

            Tactical Assault Rifle (Epic, Legendary): A burst-fire rifle added in Chapter 1 but later vaulted due to
            balance concerns.

            <br>
            Chug Jug (Legendary): A healing item that restored full health and shield, but was later vaulted due to its

            <br>
            Dual Pistols (Epic, Legendary): A pair of pistols that allowed players to rapidly fire at close range but

            Suppressed Sniper Rifle (Epic): A quieter sniper rifle that dealt less damage than the Bolt-Action, but it

            <br>
            </p>
            <h1>Bosses</h1>
            <p>While boss fights in Fortnite were a much more recent addition in later chapters, Chapter 1 did not
                feature boss characters in the way we see them today. However, certain limited-time events and special
                challenges did introduce powerful NPCs or enemies that could be considered "boss-like." Some of the key
                moments in Chapter 1's timeline involving unique, powerful foes include:</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            The Cube and its Guardians (Season 5): The mysterious Cube (Kevin) introduced during Season 5 had a range of
            interactions with the environment, including summoning powerful enemies and altering the landscape in
            various ways. The Cube didn't technically have a "boss," but its influence on the environment added a layer
            of complexity and mystery to the game.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fortnite "Events" Boss Fights: Epic did introduce some NPC bosses in special events, such as Season 4's
            Thanos Event, where Thanos from Marvel's Avengers universe came to the game as a special boss character.
            Players could battle him for the chance to wield the powerful Infinity Gauntlet.</p>
