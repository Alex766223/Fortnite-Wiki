        <br>
        <h3>Assault rifle</h3>
        <br>
        Assault Weapons are typically an all-round class of weapons that are used for medium ranged combat and quickly destroying structures. Assault Weapons often have first shot accuracy, meaning they can fire their first bullet without any bloom. 
        <br>
        <h3>Burst Assault rifle</h3>
        <br>
        The Burst Assault Rifle is a burst-fire, medium ranged weapon that fires 2-round burst shots (during Fortnite OG, the weapon fired in a 3-round burst). It excels at medium ranged combat, but has the ability to perform decently at long ranges.
        <br>
        <h3>Drum gun</h3>
        <br>
        Drum Gun is a fully automatic, fast firing, closer ranged weapon dealing high amounts of damage in a close quarters environment, but being much weaker at extended ranges due to poor accuracy.
        <br>
        <h3>Pump shotgun</h3>
        <br>
        The Pump Shotgun is a high damage, short range and slow firing shotgun, best suited to very close quarters. It has 5 shells in the magazine and must be pumped between shots, leading a slow fire rate.
        <br>
        <h3>Tactical Shotgun</h3>
        <br>
        The Tactical Shotgun is a fully automatic, short ranged weapon. It fires a string of pellets when shot, which tighten on aiming down sights. The weapon can be fired continuously with no effect on accuracy.
        <br>
        <h3>Heavy Sniper</h3>
        <br>
        The Heavy Sniper Rifle is a Fast-Moving Projectile weapon. As it uses a scope, the fired bullet will always shoot from the center of the crosshair. There is no damage falloff on the Heavy Sniper Rifle's projectiles.
        <br>
