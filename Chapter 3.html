        <h1>Chapter 3: The Future of Fortnite</h1>
        <img src="Assets/Chapter 3.jpg">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Fortnite is one of the most dynamic games in the world, constantly evolving through updates, collaborations,
            and changes that keep the player experience fresh and exciting. As the game moves forward, Epic Games
            continues to experiment with new features, balancing updates, and narrative-driven content that keeps
            players engaged. This chapter takes a deep dive into the future of Fortnite, focusing on the evolution of
            weapons, the impact of bosses, and what players can expect from upcoming seasons and updates.</p>
        <h1>Weapons</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
        <h2>Weapons Added:</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Thunder Shotgun:</h3>
        <br>
        A heavy-hitting shotgun that delivers devastating damage at close range. Known for its slower fire rate but
        higher damage, the Thunder Shotgun has become a favorite among players who prefer aggressive, up-close
        combat. Expect to see more shotguns with unique traits that reward skillful timing and positioning.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Exotic Weapons:</h2>
        <br>
        Exotic weapons are unique, powerful guns available from certain NPCs in the game. These weapons could
        continue to evolve, introducing new options like energy-based weapons or sniper rifles with special
        abilities that shake up the meta. They’ll be perfect for players looking for an edge in combat.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Laser Rifle (Concept):</h3>
        <br>
        With futuristic and sci-fi-themed updates potentially on the horizon, the Laser Rifle could be an addition
        that adds an entirely new class of long-range weaponry. Featuring high accuracy and a laser beam effect, it
        could function as a counter to the more traditional sniper rifles, blending futuristic technology with
        Fortnite’s iconic gameplay.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Weapons Vaulted:</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Pump Shotgun</h3>
        <br>
        The Pump Shotgun, once a staple of Fortnite combat, was vaulted to create a more balanced and dynamic weapon
        pool. Its high damage and quick rate of fire made it an overwhelming choice in close-quarters combat. Although
        it may one day return, for now, Epic is exploring other shotguns to offer more variety in close-range combat.
        <br>
        <h3>Zapper Trap</h3>
        The Zapper Trap, which delivered an electric shock when triggered, was vaulted due to its situational nature and
        the challenge it posed to gameplay balance. The future of traps in Fortnite could involve more interactive
        environmental hazards, with traps requiring players to be more strategic in placement or triggering.
        <br>
        <h3>Infinity Blade</h3>     
        <br> 
        The Infinity Blade was a powerful melee weapon that took the game’s balance to a new level. Its removal was due
        to the fact that it was a bit too strong for regular gameplay. However, limited-time or special event items like
        the Infinity Blade might return in future crossovers, with stronger balance controls to ensure they don’t
        disrupt the core experience.
        </p>
        <h1>Bosses</h1>
            <p>In Fortnite: Chapter 3, there are several boss characters that players can encounter across different seasons. Below is a list of some notable bosses from Fortnite: Chapter 3:</p>
